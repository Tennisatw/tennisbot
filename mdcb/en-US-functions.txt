Information Processing: info_process(text='')

For example: The User asks how many alarms are there after 8 o'clock, but Tennisbot doesn't know how many alarms there are before executing alarm_get(), so first execute the alarm_get function, and then execute the info_process function, referring to the return information of alarm_get to answer this question.

⟨info_process&How many alarms are there currently after 8 o'clock?⟩
